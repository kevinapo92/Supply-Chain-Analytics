## Data Source 

The data used in this repository is a randomly generated dataset created specifically for demonstration and testing purposes. It does not represent real-world order data or any actual customer information. The purpose of this synthetic dataset is to provide a simulated environment for developing and testing SQL queries related to order tracking.

The dataset includes randomly generated values for various attributes such as Order ID, product, quantity ordered, price each, order date, and purchase address. please note that while the dataset has been designed to mimic the structure and characteristics of order data, it may not accurately reflect the complexity or variability of real-world scenarios. 

Three datasets were used to store the information. It includes details such as: 

* Orders_and_shipments.csv
* Inventory.csv
* fullfillment.csv
