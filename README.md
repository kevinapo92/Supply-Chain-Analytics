# Supply-Chain-Analytics

## Introduction 
Here, you'll find an illustrative example of how to approach the analysis of supply chain processes, encompassing production, sourcing, and distribution of products.

## Technologies Used
- Tableau Public
  
In this project, I utilized Tableau Public as my primary software to analyze and manipulate data. To interact with the databases.

## Data Source 

The data utilized in this repository comprises a carefully crafted dataset generated specifically for demonstration and testing purposes. It's important to note that this dataset is synthetic and doesn't reflect real-world order data or any customer information. Its sole purpose is to create a simulated environment for developing and testing Tableu skills.

The dataset encompasses various attributes such as Order ID, product details, quantity ordered, unit price, order date, and purchase address. While it mimics the structure of order data, it may not capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios.

Three distinct datasets are employed to store information:

* Orders_and_shipments.csv
* Inventory.csv
* fullfillment.csv

## Analysis
